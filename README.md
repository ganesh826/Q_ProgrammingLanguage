# 311-Project

So the project centers around making a new language to operate on queues (assuming he approves queues).

For this, we need:

[ ] BNF syntax spec

[ ] Denotational semantics spec

[x] Parser

[ ] Lexical Analyzer

[ ] Pseudo-compiler that compiles our language down to java to be run (not sure if this is necessary or not)
